    "**1. Prompt user by asking “ What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Check the user’s input to decide what to do next.\n",
    "    b. The prompt should show every time action has completed, e.g. once the drink is dispensed.\n",
    "       The prompt should show again to serve the next customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Turn off the Coffee Machine by entering “ off ” to the prompt.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. For maintainers of the coffee machine, they can use “off” as the secret word to turn off the machine. \n",
    "       Your code should end execution when this happens.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**3. Print report.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. When the user enters “report” to the prompt, a report should be generated that shows the current resource values.\n",
    "    e.g.\n",
    "    Water: 100ml\n",
    "    Milk: 50ml\n",
    "    Coffee: 76g\n",
    "    Money: $2.5\n",
    "    \n",
    "**4. Check resources sufficient?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. When the user chooses a drink, the program should check if there are enough resources to make that drink.\n",
    "    b. E.g. if Latte requires 200ml water but there is only 100ml left in the machine.\n",
    "       It should not continue to make the drink but print: “ Sorry there is not enough water. ”\n",
    "    c. The same should happen if another resource is depleted, e.g. milk or coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Process coins.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. If there are sufficient resources to make the drink selected, then the program should prompt the user to insert coins.\n",
    "    b. Remember that quarters = $0.25, dimes = $0.10, nickles = $0.05, pennies = $0.01\n",
    "    c. Calculate the monetary value of the coins inserted. \n",
    "    E.g. 1 quarter, 2 dimes, 1 nickel, 2 pennies = 0.25 + 0.1 x 2 + 0.05 + 0.01 x 2 = $0.52\n",
    "    \n",
    "**6. Check transaction successful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Check that the user has inserted enough money to purchase the drink they selected.\n",
    "    E.g Latte cost $2.50, but they only inserted $0.52 then after counting the coins the program should say\n",
    "       “ Sorry that's not enough money. Money refunded. ”.\n",
    "    b. But if the user has inserted enough money, then the cost of the drink gets added to the machine as the profit and\n",
    "       this will be reflected the next time “report” is triggered. \n",
    "       E.g.\n",
    "        Water: 100ml\n",
    "        Milk: 50ml\n",
    "        Coffee: 76g\n",
    "        Money: $2.5\n",
    "    c. If the user has inserted too much money, the machine should offer change.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    E.g. “Here is $2.45 dollars in change.” The change should be rounded to 2 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Make Coffee.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. If the transaction is successful and there are enough resources to make the drink the user selected, then the\n",
    "       ingredients to make the drink should be deducted from the coffee machine resources.\n",
    "    E.g. report before purchasing latte:\n",
    "            Water: 300ml\n",
    "            Milk: 200ml\n",
    "            Coffee: 100g\n",
    "            Money: $0\n",
    "    Report after purchasing latte:\n",
    "        Water: 100ml\n",
    "        Milk: 50ml\n",
    "        Coffee: 76g\n",
    "        Money: $2.5\n",
    "    b. Once all resources have been deducted, tell the user “Here is your latte. Enjoy!”. \n",
    "       If latte was their choice of drink."
